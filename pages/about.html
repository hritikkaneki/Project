    			<p>
    			As we continue to grow, we don’t lose sight of what’s most important—people. Hotel Luxury is a company that was built by family. It’s a workplace where coworkers become friends. Every day we care for our guests. Care is at the heart of our business, and it’s this distinct guest experience that makes Hyatt one of the world’s best hospitality brands.At  Hotel Luxury we guarantee check-in from 3.00 p.m., but if the room is ready upon your arrival, you are welcome to check-in before. If, on the other hand, the room is not ready when you arrive, you can store your luggage with us at no charge until the room is available.Check-out from the room is at 12.00 p.m. at the latest, but if you need a late check-out, then contact our reception upon arrival, or during your stay, and we will do our best to accommodate your request. Similar to check-in, you have the option to store your luggage when checking out.If you're busy and can pay with a credit card, or your accommodation is already pre-paid, you can make use of our popular Express Check-out and avoid the waiting time. Our Express Check-out stands can be found in the lobby right next to the main entrance. The receipt for your stay will then be sent via e-mail on the same day.</p>
